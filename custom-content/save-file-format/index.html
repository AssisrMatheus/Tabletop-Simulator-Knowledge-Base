                  <h1>Save File Format</h1>
                
                <p>Saving now uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON serialization</a> for easy to use, human readable format. More specifically, <strong>JSON .NET for Unity</strong>. This page is a technical document which can be used to better understand how an in-game table is recorded into a save file.</p>
<p>You can modify the physics properties of an object in the save file. By adding and modifying the <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-PhysicMaterial.html">PhysicsMaterial</a> and <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-Rigidbody.html">Rigidbody</a>. You can see an example of that in the JSON below.</p>
<p>You can also change an objects scaling separately in each axis, unlike the uniform only scaling in-game.</p>
<p>If you make any mistakes when editing a save, the chat will spit out a debugging error for troubleshooting.
If you have any questions on this topic feel free to post about it on our forums.</p>
