                  <h1>Context Menu</h1>
                
                <p>The Context Menu is the menu that appears when you <code class="codehilite">right-click</code> while in-game, generally on an Object. You can do pretty much anything in the Contextual Menu, with deck and dice options, tinting, saving to chest, scripting and much more.</p>
<p><center><img alt="Basic Context Menu" src="../../img/context-menu/basic.png" /></center></p>
<h2 id="context-menu-layout">Context Menu Layout<a class="headerlink" href="#context-menu-layout" title="Permanent link"> </a></h2>
<p>There are many different options to choose from and depending on the object, there may be unique options.</p>
<ul>
<li>Top Section: Options that are specific to this object</li>
<li>Lower Sections: Options that are available on all objects.</li>
</ul>

</center></p>
<h2 id="options">Options<a class="headerlink" href="#options" title="Permanent link"> </a></h2>
<p>Depending on the object you right click on, the Contextual Menu may show different options. You can always save the object to your Chest, tint the color of it, modify the physics, flip it over or rotate it, copy and delete it. You can also give the object a name and description. The “Name” field will show over the object as a tool tip with the description appearing if the mouse continues to hover there for over a second.</p>
<h2 id="toggles">Toggles<a class="headerlink" href="#toggles" title="Permanent link"> </a></h2>
<p>The Toggles sub-menu allows you to change how this object interacts with the rest of the game.</p>
<p><center><img alt="Toggles Context Menu" src="../../img/context-menu/toggle.png" /></center></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lock</strong>: If the object stays locked in place. Locked objects can also be stamped/decaled/snap pointed.</li>
<li><strong>Grid</strong>: If the object will snap to grid when dropped. The grid feature for the table must also be enabled.</li>
<li><strong>Snap</strong>: If the object moves towards snap points when dropped.</li>
<li><strong>Auto Raise</strong>: If the object is lifted over others while being carried.</li>
<li><strong>Tooltip</strong>: If the object's name/description are displayed.</li>
<li><strong>Sticky</strong>: If objects placed on top of this object stay there when this object is picked up.</li>
<li><strong>Hands</strong>: If this object can be held in a player's hand zone.</li>
<li><strong>Persistent</strong>: If this object persists through changing tables/games.</li>
<li><strong>Grid Projection</strong>: If this object can have a grid projected on it if grid displays are enabled.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="global-context-menu">Global Context Menu<a class="headerlink" href="#global-context-menu" title="Permanent link"> </a></h2>
<p>The Global Contextual Menu has extra functions that can be used without clicking on a particular object.</p>
<p><center><img alt="Camera States Context Menu" src="../../img/context-menu/camera.png" /></center></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Camera Mode</strong>: Switch between 3'rd, 1'st and top-down viewing modes. <span class="critic comment">Shortcut: P</span></li>
<li><strong>Load Camera</strong>: Load pre-set camera viewing angles. <span class="critic comment">Shortcut: 1-9</span></li>
<li><strong>Save Camera</strong>: Create a pre-set camera viewing angle. <span class="critic comment">Shortcut: Shift + 1-9</span></li>
<li><strong>Blindfold</strong>: Apply/remove blindfold from yourself. <span class="critic comment">Shortcut: B</span></li>
<li><strong>Paste</strong>: Paste any copied object/objects.<span class="critic comment">Shortcut: Ctrl + V</span></li>
