<p>With the Joint Tool selected, mouse-over an item and hold left-click. Drag the cursor over the object you want to connect and then release left-click.</p>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p>For the best results, always go <strong>FROM</strong> the object <strong>TO</strong> the base.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> If you are connecting a spinning arrow to a wheel, you would go from the arrow to the wheel, not from the wheel to the arrow.</p>

<h2 id="removing-joints">Removing Joints<a class="headerlink" href="#removing-joints" title="Permanent link"> </a></h2>
<p>Removing joints is easy. Begin to create a new joint on the object your originally started the joint on, but this time attach it to nothing. This will cause the old joint to detach.</p>
<h2 id="modifying-joints">Modifying Joints<a class="headerlink" href="#modifying-joints" title="Permanent link"> </a></h2>
<p><center><img alt="Modified Jointing" src="../../img/joint-tool/joint-modified.gif" /></center></p>
<p>More than solid joints are available, you just need to modify an existing joint to alter its properties.</p>
<ul>
<li>Right-click on the object you started the joint on, and the context menu will appear.</li>
<li>Clicking on "Joint" will open the Joint menu, which displays the properties of the joint.<ul>
<li><strong>Fixed</strong>: A solid joint, not meant to move or twist.</li>
<li><strong>Hinge</strong>: A solid joint that can twist. "Motor" force can also be applied, causing rotation.</li>
<li><strong>Spring</strong>: A flexible joint.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Each type has its own properties which can be modified to change the joints behavior. Mousing over the <code class="codehilite">?</code> next to each property will provide information on what it does.</li>
<li>When you're done, his Apply or Save &amp; Exit to save the changes.</li>
<li>Hitting X in the upper right will close the menu without saving any changes.</li>
</ul>
