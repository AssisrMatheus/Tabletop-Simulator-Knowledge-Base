                  <h1>Zone Tools</h1>
                
                <p>The zone tools allow you to create areas on the table that have different impacts on game objects inside them. Hand zones are particularly important because they determine the "seats" a player is able to "sit" in.</p>
<h2 id="general-zone-modification">General Zone Modification<a class="headerlink" href="#general-zone-modification" title="Permanent link"> </a></h2>
<p>Although all zone types work differently, the creation and modification of them is all similar.</p>
<h3 id="creation">Creation<a class="headerlink" href="#creation" title="Permanent link"> </a></h3>
<p>With your mouse, left-click and hold. Drag your mouse so that the created zone will have the desired width/depth, then release.</p>
<h3 id="removal">Removal<a class="headerlink" href="#removal" title="Permanent link"> </a></h3>
<p>With the same zone tool selected, left-clicking on a pre-existing zone will remove it.</p>
<h3 id="modification">Modification<a class="headerlink" href="#modification" title="Permanent link"> </a></h3>
<p>Right-clicking on a pre-existing zone will provide some additional feature/options. What the right-click does depends on the zone type. Details can be found below, in the following sections.</p>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p>When you draw a zone, you aren't stuck with the shape you made it! All zones can be moved/resized/rotated by using the <a href="../gizmo-tool/">Gizmo Tool</a>.</p>
</div>
<hr />
<h2 id="zone-types">Zone Types<a class="headerlink" href="#zone-types" title="Permanent link"> </a></h2>
<p>Each zone has different rules when it comes to visibility, right-click functionality and more. This section outlines those differences.</p>
<h3 id="hidden-zone">Hidden Zone<a class="headerlink" href="#hidden-zone" title="Permanent link"> </a></h3>
<p><img alt="Hidden Zone Menu" src="../../img/zone-tools/hidden-zone-menu.png" /></p>
<p>A hidden zone is an area that is able to hide objects from certain players. It can hide those objects from all other player colors or just one. The GM <em>(Black seat)</em> is always able to see what is within any hidden zone.</p>
<p>Hidden zones are visible to all players during gameplay, although their contents are hidden.</p>
<h4 id="right-click-action">Right-Click Action<a class="headerlink" href="#right-click-action" title="Permanent link"> </a></h4>
<p>Right-clicking on a hidden zone will bring up a color circle and a gear icon.</p>
<p><center><img alt="Hidden Zone Right Click" src="../../img/zone-tools/hidden-rc1.png" /></center></p>
<p>Clicking on a color will set the hidden zone will set the zone to match that color player. This determines who it is hiding for.</p>
<p>Clicking on the gear will open the options for this specific hidden zone.</p>
<p><center><img alt="Hidden Zone Right Click Sub-menu" src="../../img/zone-tools/hidden-rc2.png" /></center></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hide Pointers</strong>: If checked, the zone will hide pointers that are within the zone, preventing any clues to what is being done in it.</li>
<li><strong>Reverse Hiding</strong>: If checked, it will reveal its contents to all other players. Unchecked, it hides the contents from everyone but the select color.</li>
<li><strong>See-through</strong>: If checked, the hidden zone is semi-transparent. If unchecked, it is a solid color. Either way, you cannot see the contents.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="randomize-zone">Randomize Zone<a class="headerlink" href="#randomize-zone" title="Permanent link"> </a></h3>
<p><img alt="Randomize Zone Menu" src="../../img/zone-tools/randomize-zone-menu.png" /></p>
<p>A randomize zone will, any time the game is loaded, ask if you want to randomize the objects inside of it. The randomization will shuffle the positions of loose tokens as well as the order of tokens in a stack/cards in a deck. </p>
<p>Randomize zones are invisible to all players unless you select the randomize zone or gizmo tools.</p>
<h4 id="right-click-action_1">Right-Click Action<a class="headerlink" href="#right-click-action_1" title="Permanent link"> </a></h4>
<p>Right-clicking a randomization zone will bring up the confirmation window to randomize the zone's contents.</p>
<p><center><img alt="Randomize Zone Right Click" src="../../img/zone-tools/randomize-rc1.png" /></center></p>
<hr />
<h3 id="hand-zone">Hand Zone<a class="headerlink" href="#hand-zone" title="Permanent link"> </a></h3>
<p><img alt="Hand Zone Menu" src="../../img/zone-tools/hand-zone-menu.png" /></p>
<p>A hand zone represents a player color. It not only determines where their "seat" is, but also is an area that holds items. Similar to a hidden zone, the contents of a hand zone can be hidden, but with special additional options. The contents of your primary hand zone are also able to be shown on your screen in an easy-access pop-up panel.</p>
<p>Hand zones are invisible to all players unless you select the hand zone or gizmo tools.</p>
<h4 id="right-click-action_2">Right-Click Action<a class="headerlink" href="#right-click-action_2" title="Permanent link"> </a></h4>
<p>Right-clicking on a hand zone will bring up a color circle.</p>
<p><center><img alt="Hand Zone Right Click" src="../../img/zone-tools/hand-rc1.png" /></center></p>
<p>Clicking on a color will set the hand zone will set the zone to match that color player. This determines who the zone belongs to. If this is the first hand zone of this color on the table, it also determines where that player "sits".</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="scripting-zone">Scripting Zone<a class="headerlink" href="#scripting-zone" title="Permanent link"> </a></h3>
<p><img alt="Script Zone Menu" src="../../img/zone-tools/script-zone-menu.png" /></p>
<p>A scripting zone has no impact on game objects itself, but it can be utilized by Lua scripting to detect/affect objects in an area. It has no use outside of scripting.</p>
<p>Scripting zones are invisible to all players unless you select the hand zone or gizmo tools.</p>
<h4 id="right-click-action_3">Right-Click Action<a class="headerlink" href="#right-click-action_3" title="Permanent link"> </a></h4>
<p>Right-clicking on a scripting zone copies it GUID to the clipboard. You can then paste it into your scripts. This is generally how you identify scripting zones in your code.</p>
<p><center><img alt="Script Zone Right Click" src="../../img/zone-tools/script-rc1.png" /></center></p>
<p>You will see a pop-up message announcing that this has been done, as well as a message in the Game chat log.</p>
